# C_Problem_solutions
These code are the solutions for the problems given in this file. 
Those are the introductory problems and migh not be of high importance but they have some informative knowledge particularly for me

The solution to the Problem10 (on the functions section) might not be exactly correct but it displays all the matches until the first digits becomes 3
